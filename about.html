        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a hardworking, curious and dedicated individual willing to be challenged to grow my skillset.
            I have an appetite to learn new technical skills, showcasing discipline that is needed to reach my ambitions.
            Collaborative skills are my strong suit â€” able to show efficiency in communication with others, sometimes being able to naturally step up as a leader if necessary.
            I know my way around a few programming languages such as Python, C and C++, C# and Java that have a wide range of uses from web development, data analytics, database design, and object-oriented programming.
            I have gained a good grasp of knowledge in database design and management, cybersecurity, networking design, GitHub, advanced Excel, and computer hardware usage.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I am curious about a variety of topics. As aforementioned, I have an appetite to learn even in my hobbies. I am intrigued by science, technology, and history.
            Movies, gaming, anime, board/card games, comics/manga, and TV series are some of my hobbies I enjoy in my free time.
        </p>

        <h2>Languages and Skills</h2>
        <p>
            I am fluent in English and Afrikaans, and I have a good grasp of Sesotho, while being passively fluent in Zulu and Setswana.
            I am confident with computer hardware and possess strong skills in communication, teamwork, and patience.
